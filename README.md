### Third Party APIs using Python3
Current Manifest Space Population aboard ISS and location within 10 second timeout



### Using Python3 Geopy library and third party APIs

1. Following documentation from skickar here on GitHub
2. [geocoder 0.6.0](https://pypi.org/project/geocoder/0.6.0/) documentation
3. [geopy 2.0.0](https://pypi.org/project/geopy/) documentation
4. API timeout 
5. [Simple Python Version Management: pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/tree/c52d26d8dbc7a0f9c7d4d4f8886fe5d1f7dbd563#understanding-path) documentaion
6. [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) 
   
### Lessons Learned
1. After converting from bash to zshrc, the frustration of converting alias and environment to zshrc from bash
1. pip or pip3 install, documentation indicated pip but my shell commands required pip3
1. Every day coding and the importance of indentation in Python scripts

### I had such a great time working with third-party API's and getting back into Python scripts after my Java 16-week immersive, code everyday!
